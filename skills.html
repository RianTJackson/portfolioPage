                <h4>Known Code Languages</h4>
                <ul>
                <li> Html, CSS, Java script: I have enough knowledge of these languages to design and maintain web pages. For more custom web sites and applcations I am willing to adapt and expand my skills to fit the scope of the 
                    project. </li>
                <li> PHP: I am just starting to learn this language and hope to expand my knowledge while working on a real world use case. </li>
                <li> MySql: I have a good foundation in this language and understand it well enough to get started with datahbas3e design and integration taks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        My exprence in graphic design supports both poster and interface work. I have desinged posters for theatre productions, beekeeper associations as well as enhancing my own web pages and applications.

                <h2 class="sectionL2">Soft Skills</h2>
                <h4>People Skills & Problem Solving</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    My last two years at FSU I worked on a team of support staff for the Innovation Hub and Fabrication Lab (a high tech maker space on campus). My role included assisting researchers, faculty, staff and students with design, production and troubleshooting custom projects. Lab resources included 3D printers, vinyl cutters, CNC, laser engravers, and prototype software modelling. 
                    This job provided experience working with people of different backgrounds, areas of expertise, and
                     skill levels while requiring me to address multiple people's requests at the same time.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                    This position was also where I learned many of my on-the-fly problem-solving skills, as many of the machines in that space were touch-and-go and workarounds were frequently needed. When people brought in files to be cut out, 
                    printed or etched there were many hardwhere and softwhere compatibility issues that I was able to resolve. 
                </li>  
                </ul>
        
                <h4>User-centered design</h4>
        
                <ul>
                    <li>I selected courses that emphasized user-focused design. Thus, I have a good understanding of the concept as well as how and, more importantly, when to implement it.</li>
                </ul>
