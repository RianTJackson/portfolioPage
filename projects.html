    <h3>Bj's Party House Intake Form</h3>
    <p>
    The goal of this project was a complete redesign of the client intake for Bj's partyhouse, a locale clown, and a performer troupe. During the length of this project, I designed and implemented the intake form currently on their page. <br> <br>
    Before this project, performer requests and contract creation were done entirely manually. Through this process, I modified the Wix page to make a comprehensive and flexible form where the output is an email that serves as a template contract. <br> <br>
    Some of the challenges that I faced in this project were my unfamiliarity with the Wix platform, the fact that the platform had been designed by previous students and had some major bugs, and my clients being unsure of what exactly they wanted. <br><br>
    In the end, there are still some things that I could have improved on, like the readability of the form, but overall, it worked and the clients liked it, and that was what mattered. <br><br>
    One feature I am most impressed with is the price estimation calculator I built into the system.

    <h3>Self Hosted PhP & MySql web Aplcation</h3>
    <p>
                
    This project was started when I was having some trouble navigating the wiki for a lion collection game I play. As I was looking through the wiki, 
    I thought this was an amazing dataset, and having some web application that could list the requirements for a base just by entering its name would be nice. <br> <br>
    Thus, I started brushing up on my PHP and leveraging my SQL skills and ended up. 
    with this application. The whole thing is hosted on a Pi4 and is run with MaranaDB and PhPMyadmin. The function takes an input, compares the name to the database of names, then replies with what kind of base was entered and returns other 
                important infromation.  <br> <br>
    
    This project taught me a lot about connecting PHP and SQL, designing SQL statements for use in web-based applications, and hosting a web server. There is more I plan to do with this project, such as expanding the search function, 
    and posably alowing for more complex serches.

    <h3>My Portfolio Page</h3>
    <p>
                
    This portfolio page was built not only as a way to clearly list my qualifications and skills but also as a self-portfolio. The entire page is coded without the use of templets. The entire code for this page can be found here. 
    on my github page. <br><br>
    
    Working on hand-coded pages like this is a great way to brush up on topics such as coding best practices as well as learn how to do new things with code. <br>
    This section was actually something I learned about while building this page. The swapping effect is done by having JS functions tied to each button that change the display to none for all divs except the selected one.
